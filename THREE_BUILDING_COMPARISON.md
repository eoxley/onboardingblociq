## Compliance Analysis

### Required Assets by Building Size

```
Small Building (8 units, 14m)       →  27 required assets
Large Building (82 units, 30m)      →  37 required assets  (+10)
Very Large + Facilities (112 units) →  40 required assets  (+13)
```

**Key Drivers for Additional Requirements:**
- **Height:** 18m+ triggers Dry Riser, Lightning Protection, Balcony Inspection
- **Height:** 30m+ triggers Sprinkler System
- **Units:** More units = more complex systems = more requirements
- **Special Facilities:** Gym/Pool/Sauna add Water Hygiene, Shower Descaling requirements
- **BSA Registration:** All buildings 18m+ require Safety Case, Resident Engagement

### Compliance Rate Analysis

| Building | Rate | Current | Missing | Status |
|----------|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Connaught Square | **10.3%** | 3/27 | 24 | 🔴 Critical |
| Pimlico Place | **24.3%** | 9/37 | 28 | 🟠 Poor |
| 50KGS | **37.5%** | 15/40 | 25 | 🟡 Fair |

**Why low compliance rates are expected:**
- System now tracks **50+ asset types** (vs 13 before)
- Building Safety Act 2022 introduced many new requirements
- Many assets historically not tracked
- Missing inspections identified for scheduling
- **This is the system working correctly** - exposing gaps

## Recommendations

### 1. Review New Contract Types
All 52 new types have been exported to JSON files for each building. Recommend:
- Review each new type
- Add appropriate keywords for validated types
- Merge to `KNOWN_CONTRACTS` in `adaptive_contract_compliance_detector.py`
- Re-run extractions for improved confidence

### 2. Address Compliance Gaps
Average 26% compliance rate indicates significant gaps:
- **Immediate:** Schedule expired inspections (FRA, Legionella)
- **Short-term:** Commission missing critical assets (Fire Alarm, Emergency Lighting)
- **Medium-term:** Complete missing high-priority assets (AOV, Balcony Inspection)
- **Long-term:** Address low-priority gaps (Shower Descaling, Pest Control)

### 3. Pursue Outstanding Balances
£395k outstanding across 135 leaseholders (67%):
- Implement payment plans for high balances (£10k+)
- Send reminders for medium balances (£1k-£10k)
- Standard follow-up for small balances (<£1k)

### 4. Enhance Data Collection
Some gaps identified:
- **Connaught Square:** 100% coverage ✅
- **Pimlico Place:** 100% coverage ✅
- **50KGS:** 98.2% coverage (2 units missing leaseholder details)
