# BlocIQ Data Extraction - Final Enhancements Complete

## üéØ Summary

Successfully implemented **two critical enhancements** to the BlocIQ data extraction system:

### 1. ‚úÖ Compliance Asset Inference Engine
**Intelligently infers missing/forgotten compliance assets** using regulatory requirements and building characteristics.

### 2. ‚úÖ Leaseholder Extraction & Unit Linking
**Extracts leaseholder names, correspondence addresses, and contact details**, then links them to units.

---

## üìä Enhancement 1: Compliance Asset Inference

### Problem Solved
Many compliance assets get **forgotten or missed** over time. For example:
- AOVs (Automatic Opening Vents) present but not tested in 3 years
- Gas safety certificates expired and overlooked
- Fire alarms exist but no inspection record found
- Emergency lighting forgotten about entirely

### Solution: Smart Inference Engine

**File:** `compliance_asset_inference.py`

**How It Works:**

1. **Regulatory Requirements Check** - Determines which assets are legally required based on:
   - Building height (11m+ requires BSA compliance, fire doors, AOVs)
   - Number of units (4+ requires fire alarm, emergency lighting)
   - Services (gas boiler requires gas safety, water system requires legionella testing)
   - Building age (pre-2000 requires asbestos survey)
   - Presence of lifts (requires LOLER inspections)

2. **Evidence Search** - Scans all documents for keywords:
   - Filenames and content searched for asset-specific terms
   - Dates extracted from old inspection documents
   - Overdue period calculated from last known inspection

3. **Inference Logic** - Categorizes assets as:
   - **Current**: Valid certification in place
   - **Expired**: Was inspected but now overdue
   - **Inferred (Evidence Found)**: Old documents found, likely forgotten
   - **Missing (Regulatory Required)**: No evidence but legally required

### Supported Asset Types (13)

| Asset Type | Regulatory Basis | Frequency | Required When |
|------------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **FRA** | RRO 2005 | 12 months | Always |

| **Legionella** | L8 ACOP | 24 months | Hot water/heating |
| **Asbestos** | CAR 2012 | 36 months | Pre-2000 buildings |
| **Fire Door** | BSA 2022 | 12 months | 11m+ buildings |
| **Fire Alarm** | BS 5839-1 | 12 months | 4+ units or 3+ floors |

}
```

## üìä Enhancement 2: Leaseholder Extraction & Unit Linking

### Problem Solved
Need to **identify leaseholders for each unit** with their contact details for:
- Service charge billing
- Emergency contact
- Correspondence
- Debt collection
- AGM notices

### Solution: Multi-Source Leaseholder Extractor

**File:** `leaseholder_extractor.py`

**Data Sources (3):**

1. **Lease Documents** (`1. CLIENT INFORMATION/1.02 LEASES/`)
   - Extracts tenant/leaseholder name
   - Title number (Land Registry)
   - Demised premises (Flat X)
   - Correspondence address

2. **Correspondence Folders** (`8. FLAT CORRESPONDENCE/Flat X/`)
   - Unit-specific subfolders
   - Extracts names from "Dear X" salutations
   - Postal addresses (UK postcode detection)
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers

3. **Service Charge Accounts** (`2. FINANCE/`)
   - Billing addresses
   - Payment status
   - Contact details

### Extraction Patterns

**Name Extraction:**
- `(2) John Smith` - Lease party format
- `TENANT: John Smith`
- `Dear Mr John Smith` - Correspondence
- `John Smith` - First line of letters

**Address Extraction:**
- UK postcode regex: `[A-Z0-9]{2,4} \d[A-Z]{2}`
- 2-3 lines before postcode
- Full address assembly

**Contact Details:**
- Email: Standard email regex
- Phone: `Tel:`, `Mobile:`, `0XXXXXXXXXX`, `+44XXXXXXXXXX`

### Real-World Results - Connaught Square

**Total Units:** 8  
**Leaseholders Found:** 2  
**Units Linked:** 2  
**Missing:** 6 (75% of units)

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "unit_number": "Flat 7",
  "unit_reference": "CS007",
  "leaseholder_name": "Managing Agent",
  "correspondence_address": "15 Young Street, London, W8 5EH",
  "email": null,
  "phone": null,
  "title_number": null,
  "data_sources": ["correspondence"],
  "data_quality": "medium"
}
```

**Note:** Limited results due to Land Registry "Official Copy" leases containing minimal personal data. Real lease originals would yield better extraction.

## üí° Key Innovations

### 1. Regulatory Intelligence
- **Self-aware system** that knows what compliance assets a building SHOULD have
- Based on UK regulatory framework (RRO 2005, BSA 2022, LOLER, etc.)
- Accounts for building-specific characteristics

### 2. Evidence-Based Inference
- Searches document corpus for historical evidence
- Calculates overdue periods from old inspections
- Prioritizes missing assets by criticality

### 3. Multi-Source Data Fusion
- Combines lease data + correspondence + accounts
- Deduplicates and merges contact information
- Links disparate data sources to unified unit records

### 4. Actionable Insights
```
üî¥ EXPIRED ASSETS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:
   - FRA: Last 2023-12-07
   - Legionella: Last 2022-06-07

‚ö†Ô∏è  MISSING ASSETS (LIKELY FORGOTTEN):
   - Fire Alarm: critical priority
   - Lift: critical priority
   - Gas Safety: critical priority
```
