# 📊 PIMLICO PLACE vs CONNAUGHT SQUARE - DATA COMPARISON

## 🔍 **WHY PIMLICO REPORT LOOKS INCOMPLETE**

The Pimlico Place extraction was **partial** - it didn't extract all the same data types as Connaught Square.

|-----------|---------------|------------------|

**Pimlico Place:** Basic extraction only

- Compliance assets found
- Contract folders detected but names not extracted
- Budget/insurance files not processed

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

1. Use the BlocIQ Onboarder desktop app or command line
2. Process the full Pimlico Place folder
3. It will extract ALL the missing data
4. Generate complete SQL and PDF

**Or:**

If budget/contractor data doesn't exist in the Pimlico Place documents, then this is all the data available and the report is correct!

---

## ✅ **THE REPORT IS ACCURATE**

The PDF report is showing exactly what was extracted from Pimlico Place - it's not pulling Connaught data. It just has less data because:
1. The extraction was partial
2. Or the documents don't contain that information

Would you like to re-run the extraction for Pimlico Place?
