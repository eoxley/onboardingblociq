## How to Delete a Building and All Related Data

If you need to remove a building due to a corrupt SQL run or incorrect data import, use this script to cleanly delete the building and all its related records.

### Delete Building Script

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    v_building_id uuid := 'YOUR-BUILDING-ID-HERE'; -- CHANGE THIS to your building ID
BEGIN
    -- Delete in order of dependencies (children first, then parents)

    -- 1. Delete compliance inspections (references compliance_assets)
    DELETE FROM compliance_inspections WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted compliance_inspections';

    -- 2. Delete compliance assets (references building)
    DELETE FROM compliance_assets WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted compliance_assets';

    -- 3. Delete major works projects (references building)
    DELETE FROM major_works_projects WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted major_works_projects';

    -- 4. Delete leaseholders (references units)
    DELETE FROM leaseholders WHERE unit_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM units WHERE building_id = v_building_id
    );
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted leaseholders';

    -- 5. Delete units (references building)
    DELETE FROM units WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted units';

    -- 6. Delete building documents (references building)
    DELETE FROM building_documents WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted building_documents';

    -- 7. Finally delete the building
    DELETE FROM buildings WHERE id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted building';

    RAISE NOTICE 'All data for building % deleted successfully', v_building_id;
END $$;
```

### How to Use

1. Find your building ID from the Supabase `buildings` table
2. Replace `'YOUR-BUILDING-ID-HERE'` with your actual building UUID
3. Run the script in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Check the notifications to confirm all deletions

### Example

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    v_building_id uuid := '93c82651-4c34-4461-976f-660c20b52bc8';
BEGIN
    -- ... rest of script
END $$;
```

### Preview Before Deleting

If you want to see what will be deleted first without actually deleting:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    v_building_id uuid := 'YOUR-BUILDING-ID-HERE'; -- CHANGE THIS
    v_count integer;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM compliance_inspections WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'compliance_inspections: % records', v_count;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM compliance_assets WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'compliance_assets: % records', v_count;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM major_works_projects WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'major_works_projects: % records', v_count;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM leaseholders WHERE unit_id IN (SELECT id FROM units WHERE building_id = v_building_id);
    RAISE NOTICE 'leaseholders: % records', v_count;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM units WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'units: % records', v_count;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count FROM building_documents WHERE building_id = v_building_id;
    RAISE NOTICE 'building_documents: % records', v_count;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Total records that would be deleted (excluding building itself)';
END $$;
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Foreign Key Constraint Error

**Error Message:**
```
Unable to delete row as it is currently referenced by a foreign key constraint from the table compliance_assets
```

**Solution:** Use the deletion script above. It deletes all dependent records in the correct order before deleting the building.

### Issue: Building Name Extracted Incorrectly

**Problem:** Building imported with name "Important" instead of actual building name.

**Solution:**
1. Delete the corrupt building using the script above
2. Re-run the onboarding with explicit building name:
   ```bash
   python3 onboarder.py "/path/to/folder" --building-name "Actual Building Name"
   ```
3. Or use the desktop app and fill in the building name field

The latest version of the onboarder now automatically extracts building names from folder names (e.g., "219.01 CONNAUGHT SQUARE" â†’ "Connaught Square").

## Best Practices

1. **Always preview before deleting** - Run the preview script to see what will be affected
2. **Verify building ID** - Double-check you have the correct building UUID before running deletion
3. **Keep backups** - The onboarder automatically creates backups in `output/client-backup/`
4. **Test migrations** - Review `output/migration.sql` before executing in Supabase
5. **Use explicit building names** - When in doubt, provide `--building-name` to avoid extraction errors
