## 📊 COMPLIANCE COVERAGE ANALYSIS

### ✅ Assets Found
1. ✅ Legionella - Current, dated
2. ✅ EICR - Found but no date
3. ✅ Fire Risk Assessment - Found but expired
4. ✅ Fire Door Inspection - Found but no date
5. ✅ Gas Safety - Found but no date
6. ✅ Asbestos Survey - Found but no date
7. ✅ Emergency Lighting - Found but no date

### ⚠️ Date Extraction Issues
**Only 2 of 7 (29%)** have assessment dates extracted:
- ✅ Legionella: 21 Aug 2025
- ✅ Fire Risk Assessment: 1 Apr 2024

**Dates need extraction for:**
- ⚠️ EICR
- ⚠️ Fire Door Inspection (likely in filename: 2024-01-24)
- ⚠️ Gas Safety
- ⚠️ Asbestos Survey
- ⚠️ Emergency Lighting (likely in filename: 08042025)

---

## 🔍 DATE EXTRACTION PATTERNS FOUND

Some dates are in **filenames** rather than document text:
- `2024-01-24T120743` → Fire Door Inspection date
- `08042025` → Emergency Lighting test date
- `2024-2025` → Gas Safety period

**Enhancement needed:** Extract dates from filenames when not in document body.

---

## 📈 DEDUPLICATION EFFECTIVENESS

### Before Deduplication
- **76 compliance documents** found
- Many historical versions:
  - Multiple Legionella assessments (different flats/dates)
  - Old Fire Risk Assessments
  - Historical accounts of same compliance type

### After Deduplication
- **7 unique asset types** (one per type)
- Kept **most recent** version of each
- Priority: `is_current` > `assessment_date` > `authority_score`

**Removed:** 69 historical duplicates (91% reduction!) ✅
