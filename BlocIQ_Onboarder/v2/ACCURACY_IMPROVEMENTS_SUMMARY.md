## ⚠️ REMAINING WORK

### Priority 1: Fix Contractor Extraction
Current contractors are garbage text from contracts. Need to:
- Extract from PM Comments field in budgets ("contract is with Jacksons Lift")
- Parse actual contract signatory sections properly
- Stop trying to extract from line item descriptions

### Priority 2: Fix Units Extraction
Apportionment file detected but not extracting. Need to investigate format.
