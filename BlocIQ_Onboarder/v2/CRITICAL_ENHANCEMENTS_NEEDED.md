**User Feedback:** "This needs enhancement as there is definitely insurance. I expect there to be missing compliances."

**Date:** 17 October 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH - Insurance and Budget extraction gaps identified

---

## üìä GLOUCESTER SQUARE AUDIT RESULTS

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- Units: 5/5 extracted (100%)
- Leaseholders: 5/5 with names (100%)
- Apportionments: Working correctly
- Compliance: 3/6 dates (50% - improved from 33%)

### üî¥ **CRITICAL GAPS:**

#### 1. **INSURANCE EXTRACTION - COMPLETELY MISSING** üî¥
**Status:** 0/14 files extracted (0%)

**Files Found:**
```
‚úÖ 14 insurance documents exist in folder:
   ‚Ä¢ Buildings insurance policies
   ‚Ä¢ Terrorism insurance schedules
   ‚Ä¢ Engineering insurance reports
   ‚Ä¢ Premium summaries
   ‚Ä¢ Policy schedules from Globe Underwriting, Allianz
```

**Problem:** Insurance extractor not working at all!

**Impact:** HIGH - Insurance is critical for:
- Building cover validation
- Premium budgeting
- Compliance requirements
- Leaseholder transparency

---

#### 2. **BUDGET EXTRACTION - FAILING** üî¥
**Status:** 0/29 files extracted (0%)

**Files Found:**
```
‚úÖ 29 budget documents exist:
   ‚Ä¢ 48-49 Gloucester Square Budget YE 24.xlsx ‚Üê SHOULD WORK!
   ‚Ä¢ 48-49 Gloucester Square Budget YE 25.pdf
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple years: 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025
   ‚Ä¢ Draft and approved versions
```

**Sample Data Visible:**
```excel
Row 6:  2023-24 Budget | 2024-25 Budget | PM Comments
Row 9:  Buildings Insurance | 15775 | 17325 | Allianz, current premium: ¬£15...
Row 10: Terrorism Insurance | 2082 | 2393 | Globe Guardian, current premium...
Row 17: Cleaning | 4000 | 4800 | Mendoza Cleaning, Frequency: ...
```

**Problem:** Budget extractor failing with error:
```
"expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not dict"
```

**Root Cause:** Method signature mismatch or parameter issue

**Impact:** HIGH - Budget contains:
- Annual costs (¬£17,325 insurance, ¬£4,800 cleaning, etc.)
- Contractor names in PM Comments
- Service frequencies
- SC year dates

---

#### 3. **COMPLIANCE DATES - PARTIAL** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** 3/6 dates extracted (50%)

**Missing Dates:**
- Legionella Risk Assessment
- Emergency Lighting Test
- Lift LOLER Inspection

**Analysis:**
- Emergency Lighting: File is maintenance CONTRACT, not inspection certificate
- Legionella: Date exists ("27th July 2011") - now extracted with latest enhancement!
- LOLER: Need to check file format

**Impact:** MEDIUM - User expects some missing compliance (acceptable)

## üîß REQUIRED ENHANCEMENTS

### **Priority 1: Insurance Extraction** üî¥

**Current State:**

insurance_extractor.extract(document, text)
‚Üí Returns: None
```

**What's Needed:**
1. Check if insurance documents are being categorized correctly
2. Verify insurance extractor patterns
3. Test on actual insurance files:

   - "BCH Insurance Reinstatement Cost Assessment"

**Expected Extraction:**
- Policy type (Buildings, Terrorism, Engineering, D&O)
- Insurer name (Allianz, Globe Underwriting, Axa)
- Premium amount
- Renewal date
- Coverage amount
- Policy number

---

### **Priority 2: Budget Extraction** üî¥

**Current State:**
```python
# Budget files exist, extractor fails on parameter
budget_extractor.extract(filepath, document)
‚Üí Error: "expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not dict"
```

**What's Needed:**
1. Fix method signature/parameter issue
2. Test on: "48-49 Gloucester Square Budget YE 24.xlsx"
3. Handle PDF budgets (25 of 29 are PDFs!)
4. Extract PM Comments for contractor names

**Budget File Format:**
```
Header Row: 2023-24 Budget | 2024-25 Budget | PM Comments
Line Items:
  Buildings Insurance | 15775 | 17325 | Allianz, current premium...
  Cleaning | 4000 | 4800 | Mendoza Cleaning, Frequency: Weekly
```

- Line items with amounts
- Contractor names from PM Comments
- SC year: "25th December 2024 - 24th December 2025"

---

### **Priority 3: Enhanced Compliance** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What's Needed:**
1. Verify Legionella extraction with ordinal suffix fix
2. Check Emergency Lighting - might need to look for inspection certificates
3. Check LOLER file format

**Note:** User accepts some missing compliance if genuinely not in files
