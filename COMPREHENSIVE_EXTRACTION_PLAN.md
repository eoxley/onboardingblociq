- Find assessment dates (last, next due)
- Identify assessor/company
- Parse status/recommendations

**2.3 Contract Document Reader**
- Extract contractor name
- Identify service type
- Find contract dates (start, end, renewal)
- Parse contract value

**2.4 H&S Report Analyzer**
- Read building description
- Extract floors/height from text
- Identify building systems
- Parse asset lists

## 📊 DATA QUALITY TARGETS

| Data Point | Current | Target | Method |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|
| Budget line items | ❌ Missing | ✅ All with £ | Parse Excel with openpyxl |
| Compliance dates | ⚠️ Unclear | ✅ Last + Next Due | PDF text extraction + date parsing |
| Contractor names | ⚠️ Some | ✅ All unique | Consolidate from all sources |
| Service charge dates | ❌ Missing | ✅ Demand + YE | Parse Property Form + budgets |
| Accounts dates | ❌ Missing | ✅ Issue + Approval | PDF text search |
| Building height | ❌ Missing | ✅ Meters | H&S report text extraction |
| Floor numbers | ❌ Missing | ✅ Per unit | Lease analysis + unit docs |
| Leaseholder contacts | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Email + Phone | Parse correspondence |
| Lease clauses | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Deep analysis | Full clause extraction + categorization |
| Site staff | ❌ Missing | ✅ Names + Hours | Contract PDF parsing |
