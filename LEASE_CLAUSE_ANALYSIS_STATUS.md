# Lease Clause Analysis - Status & Instructions

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ **Schema Ready, Data Extraction Needed**

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU ASKED FOR

**"Lease analysis with clauses in the Supabase migration"**

✅ **YES** - The schema now supports comprehensive lease clause extraction!  
⏳ **BUT** - The Connaught data doesn't have clause-level extraction yet

---

## ✅ WHAT'S READY (Just Added!)

### Schema Tables (In Supabase Schema Now):

1. **`lease_clauses`** - Comprehensive 28-point lease extraction
   - Clause identification (number, category, subcategory)
   - Full clause text & summaries
   - Key terms, obligations, restrictions, rights
   - Financial impact tracking
   - Importance levels & compliance flags

2. **`lease_parties`** - Who's involved
   - Lessor (landlord) details
   - Lessee (tenant) details
   - Guarantor information
   - Management company

3. **`lease_financial_terms`** - Money matters
   - Ground rent (initial, current, reviews)
   - Service charge (method, percentage, cap)
   - Insurance (method, percentage)
   - Reserve fund contributions
   - Apportionment method & percentage

---

## ⏳ WHAT'S NEEDED

### Current Connaught Data Has:

✅ **4 lease documents** tracked:
- Title numbers: NGL809841, NGL827422
- Page counts: 94 pages total
- File sizes: 6.75 MB total
- Document locations

❌ **NO clause-level extraction yet**:
- No individual clauses extracted
- No parties extracted
- No financial terms extracted

**Why:** The comprehensive lease extractor (`comprehensive_lease_extractor.py`) hasn't been run on these lease PDFs yet.

## 🚀 HOW TO GET FULL LEASE ANALYSIS

### Step 1: Apply Lease Clause Tables to Supabase (10 seconds)

**The SQL is already in your clipboard!** 📋

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. **PASTE (Cmd+V)** - `add_lease_clause_tables.sql` is in clipboard
3. Click **"Run"**
4. Verify: 3 new tables created

### Step 2: Run Comprehensive Lease Extraction (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/ellie/onboardingblociq

# Run comprehensive lease extraction on Connaught leases
python3 test_lease_extraction_complete.py \
    --building-id "2667e33e-b493-499f-ae8d-2de07b7bb707" \
    --lease-folder "/Users/ellie/Downloads/219.01 CONNAUGHT SQUARE/1. CLIENT INFORMATION/1.02 LEASES"
```

**This will extract:**
- 50-100+ individual clauses per lease
- Parties (lessor, lessee, guarantors)
- Financial terms (ground rent, service charge)
- Covenant analysis
- Restrictions & rights

### Step 3: Regenerate SQL with Lease Clauses

```bash
# After extraction completes
python3 sql_generator_v2.py \
    output/connaught_with_clauses.json \
    -o output/connaught_WITH_LEASE_CLAUSES.sql
```

### Step 4: Load to Supabase

Apply the new SQL file with lease clauses included.

### Step 5: Generate Enhanced PDF Report

```bash
python3 generate_comprehensive_report.py \
    output/connaught_with_clauses.json \
    -o output/Connaught_WITH_LEASE_ANALYSIS.pdf
```
