## üîç Verify After Running

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Verify Pimlico Place data
SELECT 
    b.building_name,
    b.num_units,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM units WHERE building_id = b.id) as actual_units,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leaseholders) as leaseholders_total,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM budgets WHERE building_id = b.id) as budgets,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM compliance_assets WHERE building_id = b.id) as compliance,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM insurance_policies WHERE building_id = b.id) as insurance,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leases WHERE building_id = b.id) as leases,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lease_clauses WHERE building_id = b.id) as lease_clauses
FROM buildings b
WHERE b.id = 'cd83b608-ee5a-4bcc-b02d-0bc65a477829';
```

**Expected:**
```
building_name: Pimlico Place
num_units: 79
actual_units: 83
leaseholders_total: 82
budgets: 197
compliance: 81
insurance: 71
leases: 265
lease_clauses: 1558

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If DELETE fails:
- Check if building exists: `SELECT * FROM buildings WHERE id = '65e81534-9f27-4464-8f04-0d4709beb8ca';`
- If it doesn't exist, skip to STEP 2

### If INSERT fails with "already exists":
- Run DELETE again
- Or change the building_id in PIMLICO_COMPLETE_FINAL.sql

### If you get foreign key errors:
- Make sure DELETE completed first
- Make sure all required tables exist (buildings, units, leaseholders, etc.)

## üìä After Success

Once both SQLs run successfully:

1. **Generate the PDF:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/ellie/onboardingblociq
   python3 generate_ultimate_report.py BlocIQ_Onboarder/output/mapped_data.json -o output/Pimlico_Place_FINAL.pdf
   ```

2. **The PDF will show:**
   - ‚úÖ 83 units (not 0)
   - ‚úÖ 82 leaseholders (not 0)
   - ‚úÖ All extracted data from Supabase
